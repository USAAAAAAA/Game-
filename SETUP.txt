SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI AI INTEGRATION
=============================================

Your game is now configured to use Google Gemini API instead of OpenAI!

STEPS TO GET IT WORKING:

1. GET YOUR GEMINI API KEY
   - Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy the generated API key

2. ADD THE API KEY TO .env FILE
   - Open the .env file in this folder
   - Replace "your_gemini_api_key_here" with your actual API key
   - Example: GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAaBbCcDdEeFfGgHhIiJjKkLlMmNnOoPp
   - Save the file

3. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
   - Open PowerShell in this folder
   - Run: npm install

4. START THE SERVER
   - Run: npm start
   - The server will start on http://localhost:3000

5. OPEN THE GAME
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000
   - The game will load automatically

6. USE THE AI QUESTION GENERATOR
   - In the game, click "Създай въпрос с AI" button
   - Configure the test settings (difficulty, keywords, number of questions)
   - Click "Генерирай тест" to generate questions using Gemini
   - Review the generated questions
   - Click "Запази теста" to save them

MODELS AVAILABLE:
- gemini-pro (default, best for text generation)
- gemini-pro-vision (for image understanding, if needed)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you get an error, make sure your API key is correct in .env
- Make sure you ran "npm install" first
- Make sure the server is running before opening the browser
- Check the browser console (F12) for any error messages
- The Gemini API has free tier limits - check your quota at https://console.cloud.google.com/

FEATURES:
- AI-generated Bulgarian literature questions
- Customizable difficulty levels (bronze, silver, gold)
- Adjustable test size (10, 20, or 30 questions)
- Optional thesis topic generation
- All questions saved locally for reuse

Enjoy your Bulgarian literature learning game!
